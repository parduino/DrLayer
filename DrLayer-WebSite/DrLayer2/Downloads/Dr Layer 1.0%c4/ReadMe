Welcome to Dr. Layer 1.0 for MacOS!

To get started, simply open the application.  After the program starts up,
hold down the 'g' key and you should observe animated wave motion in the
layered medium.  The User Guide.html file has a complete command and tool
reference, but the best way to learn to use the program is to go through
the exercises that are distributed as a companion to the Dr. Layer
program.

Dr.  Layer is brought to you by Pedro Arduino, Greg Miller, and Ayokunle
Ogunrinde at the University of Washington, and was developed under the
auspices of the Pacific Earthquake Engineering Research (PEER) Center.

(Note for Mac users: although much of the documentation is Windows-centric,
Dr.  Layer was actually developed using Macs, and it's really a Mac program
at heart.  We did not do extensive testing on pre-9.0 versions of the
operating system--let us know if you have problems by e-mailing me at
gmiller@u.washington.edu.  At a minimum, you will need to have the OpenGL
libraries installed on your system.)
