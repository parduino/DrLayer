<p>          In the following sections, transfer functions are derived for a series 
  of successively more complicated geotechnical conditions. Although the simplest 
  of these may only rarely be applicable to actual problems, they illustrate some 
  of the important effects of soil deposits on ground motion characteristics without 
  undue mathematical complexity. The more complex are capable of describing the 
  most important aspects of ground response and are very commonly used in geotechnical 
  earthquake engineering practice.</p>
<h1>Uniform Undamped Soil on Rigid Rock</h1>
<p>First, consider a uniform layer of isotropic, linear elastic soil overlying 
  rigid bedrock as shown in Figure 1. Harmonic horizontal motion of the bedrock 
  will produce vertically propagating shear waves in the overlying soil. The resulting 
  horizontal displacement can be expressed as:</p>

<p>where w is the circular frequency of ground shaking, k the wave number (=<span style='font-family:Symbol'>w</span>/<span style='font-family:
Symbol'>n</span><sub>s</sub>) and A and B the amplitudes of waves traveling in 
  the –z (upward) and +z (downward) directions, respectively. At the free surface 
  (z=0), the shear stress, and consequently the shear strain, must vanish; that 
  is,</p>

<p>Substituting () into () and differentiating yields</p>
<p class=MTDisplayEquation>                            <sub><img width=296 height=24
src="./transfer-function_files/image006.gif" v:shapes="_x0000_i1027"></sub></p>
<p>which is satisfied (nontrivially) when A=B. The displacement can then be expressed 
  as</p>
<p class=MTDisplayEquation>                               <sub><img width=269 height=44

<p>which describes a standing wave of amplitude 2A cos(kz). The standing wave 
  is produced by the constructive interference of the upward and downward traveling 
  waves and has a fixed shape with respect to depth. Equation () can be used to 
  define a transfer function that describes the ratio of displacement amplitudes 
  at any two points in the soil layer. Choosing these two points to be the top 
  and bottom of the soil layer gives the transfer function</p>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>The modulus for the transfer function is the amplification

<p>which indicates that the surface displacement is always at least as large as 
  the bedrock displacement (since the denominator can never be greater than 1) 
  and, at certain frequencies, is much larger. Thus |F1(<span
style='font-family:Symbol'>w</span>)| is the ratio of the free surface motion 
  amplitude to the bedrock motion amplitude (or, since the bedrock is rigid in 
  this case, the bedrock outcropping motion). As <span style='font-family:Symbol'>w</span>H/<span
style='font-family:Symbol'>n</span><sub>s</sub> approaches <span
style='font-family:Symbol'>p</span>/2+n<span style='font-family:Symbol'>p</span>, 
  the denominator of equation () approaches zero, which implies that infinite 
  amplification, or resonance, will occur (Figure ()). Even this very simple model 
  illustrates that the response of a soi deposit is highly dependent upon the 
  frequency of the base motion, and that the frequencies at which strong amplification 
  occurs depend on the geometry (thickness) and material properties (s-wave velocity) 
  of the soil layer.</p>
<h1>Uniform, Damped Soil on Rigid Rock</h1>
<p>Obviously, the type of unbounded amplification predicted by the previous analysis 
  cannot physically occur. The previous analysis assumed no dissipation of energy, 
  or damping, in the soil. Since damping is present in all materials, more realistic 
  results can be obtained by repeating the analysis with damping. Assuming the 
  soil to have the shearing characteristics of a Kelvin-Voigt solid, the wave 
  equation can be written as</p>

<p>As shown in the previous section, the solution to this wave equation is of 
  the form</p>
<p align=center style='text-align:center'><sub><img width=193 height=27

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>where k* is a complex wave number with real part k<sub>1</sub> 
  and imaginary part k<sub>2</sub>. Repeating the previous algebraic manipulations 
  with the complex wave number, the transfer function for the case of damped soil 
  over rigid rock can be expressed as</p>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>Since the frequency-independent complex shear modulus 
  is given by G*=G(1+i2<span
style='font-family:Symbol'>x</span>), the complex shear velocity can be expressed 
  as</p>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>for small <span style='font-family:Symbol'>x. </span>Then 
  the complex wave number can be written, again for small x, as</p>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>and finally, the trasfer function as</p>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>Using the identity |cos(x+iy)| = sqrt[cos<sup>2</sup>(x)+sinh<sup>2</sup>(y)], 
  the amplification function can be expressed as</p>
<p class=MTDisplayEquation align=center style='text-align:center'><sub><img width=227 height=49

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>Since sinh2y ~ y2 fro small y, the amplification function 
  can be simplified to</p>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>For small damping ratios, equation () indicates that 
  amplification by a damped soil layer also varies with frequency. The amplification 
  will reach a local maximum whenever kH~p/2+np but will never reach a value of 
  infinity since (for x&gt;0) the denominator will always be greater than zero. 
  The frequencies that correspond to the local maxima are the natural frequencies 
  of the soil deposit. The variation of amplification factor with frequency is 
  shown for different levels of damping in Figure (). This amplification factor 
  is also equal to the ratio of the free surface motion amplitude to the bedrock 
  (or bedrock outcropping) motion amplitude. Comparing Figures () and () shows 
  that damping affects the response at high frequencies more than at lower frequencies.

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>Since the peak amplification factor decreases with 
  increasing natural frequency, the greatest amplification factor will occur approximately 
  at the lowest natural frequency, also known as the fundamental frequency</p>

<p class=MTDisplayEquation>The characteristic site period, which depends on the 
  thickness and shear wave velocity of the soil, provides a very useful indication 
  of the period of vibration at which the most significant amplification can be 
  expected.</p>
