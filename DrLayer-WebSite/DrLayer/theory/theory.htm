        local excitation of a medium is not instantaneously detected at positions 
        that are at a distance from the region of the excitation. It takes time 
        for a disturbance to propagate from its source to other positions. This 
        phenomenon of propagation of disturbances is well known from physical 
        experience, and is usually referred as wave propagation. For example, 
        an earthquake or an underground nuclear explosion is recorded in another 
        continent well after it has occurred. … These examples illustrate mechanical 
        wave motions or mechanical wave propagation.</font></span></p>

style='font-family:Times'>Propagation of Mechanical Waves</span></b></font></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText2><span style='font-family:Times'>Mechanical waves originate 
        in the forced motion of a portion of a deformable medium. As elements 
        of the medium are deformed the disturbance, or wave, progresses through 
        the medium. In this process the resistance offered to deformation by the 
        consistency of the medium, as well as the resistance to motion offered 
        by inertia, must be overcome. As the disturbance propagates through the 
        medium it carries along amounts of energy in the forms of kinetic and 
        potential energies. Energy can be transmitted over considerable distances 
        by wave motions. The transmission of energy is effected because motion 
        is passed on from one particle to the next and not by any sustained bulk 
        motion of the entire medium. Mechanical waves are characterized by the 
        transport of energy through motions of particles about an equilibrium 
        position. Thus, bulk motions of a medium such as occur, for example, in 
        turbulence in a fluid are not wave motions.</span></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText2><span style='font-family:Times'>Deformability and 
        inertia are essential properties of a medium for the transmission of mechanical 
        wave motions. If the medium were not deformable any part of the medium 
        would immediately experience a disturbance in the form of an inertial 
        force, or an acceleration, upon application of a localized excitation. 
        Similarly, if a hypothetical medium were without inertia there would be 
        no delay in the displacement of particles and the transmission of the 
        disturbance from particle to particle would be effected instantaneously 
        to the most distant particle. All real materials are, of course, deformable 
        and possess mass and thus all real materials transmit mechanical waves.</span></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText2><span style='font-family:Times'>The inertia of the 
        medium offers resistance to motion, but once the medium is in motion inertia 
        in conjunction with resilience of the medium tends to sustain the motion. 
        If, after a certain interval the externally applied excitation becomes 
        stationary, the motion of the medium will eventually subside due to frictional 
        losses and a state of static deformation will be reached. The importance 
        of dynamic effects depends on the relative magnitudes of two characteristic 
        times: the time characterizing the external application of the disturbance 
        and the characteristic time of transmission of the disturbances across 
        the body.</span></p>

      <p class=MsoBodyText2><span style='font-family:Times'>Some of the characteristic 
        features of wave motion in a continuum can be brought out by an analysis 
        in a one-dimensional geometry. With one spatial variable the concepts 
        and principles of continuum mechanics can be deployed without the encumbrance 
        of geometrical complications to display the essential aspects of motion 
        of a continuum and to derive the governing system of equations. One-dimensional 
        linearized elastic theory is governed by a simple partial differential 
        equation whose general solution can be determined by the use of elementary 
        mathematics. </span></p>

        planes will remain planar and that stresses will be distributed uniformly 
        over each cross section. As a stress wave travels along the rod and passes 
        through the small element shown in Figure 2, the axial stress at the left

        that the particle velocity is proportional to the shear stress in the

        the specific impedance of the material. The specific impedance is another 
        important property that influences the behavior of waves at boundaries 
        (lesson…).</span></p>
      <p class=MsoBodyText2>The propagation of waves in a half-space is actually 
        more complex. Since the earth is three-dimensional and sources of seismic 
        energy are three-dimensional, seismic waves must be described in terms 
        of three-dimensional wave propagation. Derivations of three-dimensional 
        equations of motion follow the same steps as those used for one-dimensional 
        propagation; the equations of motion are formulated from equilibrium considerations, 
        stress-strain relationships, and strain-displacement relationships. In 
        the three-dimensional case, however, the various relationships are more 
        complex and the derivations more cumbersome. In this introduction to wave 
        propagation we will concentrate in the one-dimensional propagation of 
        shear waves which is of great importance in civil engineering practice.  
        A more complete analysis on the propagation of waves can be found elsewhere 
        (Kramer, Achenbach).</p>
