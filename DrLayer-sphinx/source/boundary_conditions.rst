Boundary Conditions
================================

Introduction
***************************************************

Background
***************************************************
This is related to basic structural conditions of relative fixity at layer boundaries. A fixed support is one that prevents translations or rotations but supports a moment. A partially restrained support will allow some minimal amount of rotation or translation. A free support will allow displacements and rotations at its ends. Fixed supports at the base and a free support at the ends and vice versa could suffice for the demonstration that follows.

Objective
***************************************************
The relevance of the type of wave propagation obtained from different boundary conditions will be studied and related to the impedance ratio values (discussed below) of 0 and infinity and their physical meanings i.e. infinity value indicating travel of an incident wave to a fixed support.

Things to Do
***************************************************

#. Open the Dr. Layer program. By default we get twelve layers. The top six layers are hardwired into the system with a very fast velocity. The bottom six layers are hardwired with a very slow velocity.

#. For our purposes we can select the bottom eleven layers to have a very slow wave speed.

#. Send a wave through the media with different load types and record your observation. Pay attention to the wave reflection and travel.

#. Change the top layer to medium wavespeed. Note what you observe about the wave.

#. Change the top layer to very slow wavespeed. Note what you observe about the wave.

#. Repeat with another load type.

Observation
***************************************************
The "stiffer" member on top was made to supply some degree of fixity to the support. Although perfect fixity was not attained with our method. A trend should be noticed showing the amount of reflection obtained is a function of how rigid the boundary layer is. Ideally the end member is still considered free.

On Your Own
***************************************************
#. Obtain motions along a string with

    - The string end fixed to a wall the other end held in the hands.

    - The string end free to move the other end held in the hands.
